# Reghan's SQL Portfolio
_Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my SQL projects, including queries, data analysis, and database management tasks. I use SQL to extract insights, optimize queries, and manage structured data effectively._

## About Me

I am a pediatric speech-language pathologist currently expanding my technical skills by learning SQL and Tableau to enhance data-driven decision-making. My background includes:

- Experience in speech-language pathology, specializing in articulation and language disorders

- A strong foundation in data collection, analysis, and goal tracking

- Continuous learning in SQL, Tableau, and data visualization

## Projects

### 1. Data Cleaning & Transformation

- Applied various SQL functions to clean and standardize raw datasets

- Used `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and `CAST` for data type conversions and consistency

- Removed duplicates and handled missing values

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed trends and patterns in structured datasets using SQL queries

- Created aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) to derive insights

- Filtered and sorted data with `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `ORDER BY`

### 3. Joins & Subqueries

- Combined multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`

- Implemented subqueries for nested data extraction and filtering

### 4. Performance Optimization

- Indexed tables and optimized queries for faster execution

- Applied `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` to understand query performance

## Technologies Used

*SQL* (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server, depending on the project)

*Tableau* (for data visualization and dashboard creation)

*Excel* (for additional data manipulation and analysis)
